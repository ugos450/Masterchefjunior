-Milk: Liquid activates the yeast. Whole milk is a must for the most tender dough– or you can try buttermilk. Lower fat or nondairy milks work in a pinch, but the doughnuts aren’t as flavorful or rich.
-Yeast: You can use active dry yeast or instant yeast. If using an instant yeast, your rise time will be a little shorter.
-Sugar: Sugar sweetens the doughnuts, but it also feeds the yeast, increases its activity, and tenderizes the dough.
-Eggs: Eggs provide structure and flavor.
-Butter: Melted butter promises enhanced flavor.
-Salt & Vanilla Extract: Both add flavor. Try using homemade vanilla extract.
-Nutmeg: A little nutmeg is the secret ingredient to that cozy, comforting bakery taste. If you’ve ever made my chocolate chip muffins, you know it adds a delicious pop of flavor!
-Flour: All-purpose flour is the dough’s structure. You’ll be tempted to add more and more flour as you mix the dough, but don’t. You want a very soft, pillowy dough for soft, pillowy doughnuts. The dough can still be slightly sticky. When kneading, use extra flour on your hands and work surface.
